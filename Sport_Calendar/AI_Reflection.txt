 AI Reflection

First of all, I have been using ChatGPT and CoPilot. These are AI tools I use in the project.

In the beginning of the project I said to ChatGPT, to tell me the different ways to make all the project.
With the different option that I obtained I chose the best option in my opinion to start working, but simplifying the tools it offered. 
Because the task was backend-oriented, 
so I discarded the frontend-related tools to focus more on the backend(I know it wasn't advisable to use a new technology,
but I wanted to experiment with a new one and learn about it.).

And the final decision is that I make is that I was going to use the IDE Visual Studio 2022 and the Frameworks .NET SDK.
so you can take advantage of the templates it generates for you.
Then I created my class diagram and my database, then I told the AI to help me to build the classes faster the classes
(Copilot starts telling you what to enter if you've already passed the database).

Later I asked for a little project to know how to use that technology. When I learn how to use
(how to compile, how to properly connect to the database, how to open the page) I start the real project with my own structure for the codes.

As I was building the files, I kept asking for advice on how to do it better, since I didn't have much knowledge of the tool,
and that way I could create cleaner and faster code.

Finally, once the backend was finished, I ordered it to create the HTML and CSS code 
(I tried to base it on Sportradar's colors) 
since I chose the backend and preferred to concentrate on that part and I didn't have enough time,so I didn't look at it much.

I also used it to create comments in the code, since I was unintentionally commenting in Spanish, so I also used it to comment on the code and translate the comments I had already made.

If I had had more time, I would have liked to better comply with coding standards, in addition to having achieved a more robust backend.
